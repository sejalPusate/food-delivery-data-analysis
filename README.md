🍽️ Food Delivery Data Analysis

Innomatics Research Labs – Advanced GenAI Internship Entrance Test

📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis pipeline built as part of the Innomatics Research Labs – Advanced GenAI Internship Entrance Test.
The objective of this project is to simulate a real-world data integration and analysis scenario by working with datasets from multiple sources and formats, followed by analytical insights and business-driven questions.

The project demonstrates practical skills in:

Data ingestion from heterogeneous sources (CSV, JSON, SQL)

Data cleaning and merging

Exploratory data analysis

Business insight generation using Python and Pandas

📂 Datasets Used
